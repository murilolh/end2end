I'm a Brazilian software developer, born and raised in Fortaleza - Ceara, and I've been working full-time in the field since 2010. Currently living in Toronto, ON, Canada.

In 2007 I started a Computer Science course at the [Federal University of Ceara - UFC](www.ufc.br). Until my graduation in 2011 I've learned the mathematical, logical and computational bases in this very theory focused course. I've also had the opportunity to gain my first job experience as an IT Intern working in one of the department's laboratories.

In 2009 I felt the need to start getting experience as a Software Developer, which was my aimed profession since before high school. I started searching for companies with trainee programs and applied for one at a local company called [Xseed](www.xseed.com.br/eng/). It was a great experience because me and my colleagues spent the first months in a training period learning **Java**, **Javascript**, **SQL** and basic **System's analysis**. After this period I started working in migration projects from legacy COBOL/LINCII or Natural/ADABAS to Java / **Oracle**. We used a Java application to parse legacy code to Java, which I helped to expand and maintain. At the end of 2010 my classes schedule allowed me to work full-time and I was hired as as Junior Software Developer.

After my graduation in 2011, I started working at [Cafaz](http://www.cafaz.org.br/), a health insurance company. They bought an application to control all areas of the company, developed in **NodeJS**. This application allows new code to be added by the clients, having its own version control and editor, and *Cafaz* needed someone to develop and maintain this customized code. It was a chance to getting more knowledge in **Javascript**, **Oracle** and **SOAP Web Services** as well as **Requirements Elicitation**, since I was in constant contact with both internal and external users. Sometimes they also required me to build **Android** applications and **PHP+Apache+MySQL** systems when it wasn't possible/needed to be coded in the main system.
